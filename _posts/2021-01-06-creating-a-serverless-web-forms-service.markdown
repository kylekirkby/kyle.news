    Let's take a look at how to build a serverless web forms service for static websites using AWS & the Serverless Framework
---
## Background

So it's 2021 and static websites are the new norm.

You've got a contact form for collecting leads on your website but no server to handle the form submission. 

As a result there are now many form SaaS products out there that can handle the submission of forms on your static websites for you. If you're deploying with [netlify.com](https://netlify.com), they have their own solution for this.

At Linaro, our main website ([Linaro.org](https://www.linaro.org)) is a static Jekyll website that is being statically served from an S3 bucket with a Cloudfront distribution in front of it enabling global edge requests/caching.

On this site we've got a few forms and over the years we've tried various solutions ranging from CognitoForms to simply `mailto:` links. Recently we've been using an Atlassian Jira Form Plugin, but with recent news regarding Atlassian killing off their server product, we've had to build our own solution as the plugin was either not availble in the Cloud version or stupidly expensive.

So we decided to put some time into building a simple serverless forms solution that would:

1. Allow users to submit a form directly on our static website
2. Require users to confirm their form submission via an email verification link (we'll see how this goes!)
3. Have the verified form submission create a new request in Jira 

## Let's get started

I'm assuming you're running a unix-based OS for this.

So let's install the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com) CLI.

```bash
npm install -g serverless
```

Create a new folder and cd into it:

```bash
mkdir serverless_forms_project && cd serverless_forms_project 
```
Next we'll create a new `serverless.yml` file which will store the details of our infrastructure.

```bash
touch serverless.yml
```

With the editor of your choice, open `serverless.yml` and add the following:

```yml

```

OK that's alot!ðŸ˜…

Let's break it down...

The name of our serverless service:

```yml
service: serverless-web-forms
...
```
The serverless version we're using

```yml
...
frameworkVersion: "2"
...
```
A boolean stating we want to use the .env feature to pull in our environment variables (more on this later):

```yml
useDotenv: true
```

Next up... the provider section.

The provider is simply our cloud hosting service that we are choosing to "spin-up" our infrastructure with. The Serverless Framework supports other providers such as `Azure` and `Google`.

The name the provider we're using:

```yml
provider:
  name: aws 
```
This is the current stage of our project for _multi-staged_ deployments. We can change this with the cli options.
You don't really want to deploy straight to production do you?ðŸ™ƒ

```yml
  stage: ${opt:stage}
```
This is the runtime we'd like our lambda functions to use. You could choose another runtime supported by AWS Lambda but I've gone with nodejs:

```yml
  runtime: nodejs12.x
```

The region we'd like to deploy our resources. So let's pick one of the cheapest ones:

```yml
  region: us-east-1
```

So this makes a horrible deprecation warning go away and uses the new lambda hashing version...

```yml
  lambdaHashingVersion: 20201221
```

These our environment variables that will be accessible in all lambda functions we add. `ENTRIES_TABLE` is the name of the DynamoDB table we will store our form submissions in whilst we are getting the users to click the verification link we email them. The `SNS_TOPIC_ARN` is the ARN of our Simply Notification Service topic that we'll create to let us know of any failures to our services.

```yml
  environment:
    ENTRIES_TABLE: ${self:service}-${opt:stage, self:provider.stage}
    SNS_TOPIC_ARN: !Ref FormsSNSTopic
```

Our serverless forms service will be using API Gateway to create a simple rest API to allow access to our Lambda functions. We will:
  - Secure it with an API key
    - Even though this can be omitted since it will be visible to the keen eye in the HTML source for our static website
 - Add a usage plan to stop 1337 hax0rs hammering our API and running up our bill
 - Add the permissions we need our functions to have when executing. 

This starts off our API Gateway section and `shouldStartNameWithService` will stop another deprecation warning and move the new behaviour (see more on this [here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/deprecations#api-gateway-naming-will-be-changed-to-service-stage)):

```yml
  apiGateway:
    shouldStartNameWithService: true
```

There are a few ways that the Serverless Framework supports for adding API keys. But we will keep it simple and let SF generate us a key, all we need to do is give it a name:

```yml
    apiKeys:
      - name: website
```
This is our best defence against spammers.

We'll set a monthly limit of 300 (or the upper bound of the number of requests you can reasonably expect in a month).

The throttle burst set to 2 (our maximum request bucket size in API Gateway) and rate limit is set to 1. This should be enough for our use case, feel free to change it to suit your requirements.

You can read the AWS docs on API Gateway rate limiting [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-request-throttling.html).

```yml
    usagePlan:
      quota:
        limit: 300
        period: MONTH
      throttle:
        burstLimit: 2
        rateLimit: 1
```

SF will create an IAM role that will be attached to our Lambda functions.

This section allows us to control what permissions we want to give our functions.

- DynamoDb permissions will be needed to add/query/delete our form submissions.
- SES for sending our verification emails.
- STS is probably quite specific to our setup since we needed to have the lambda function assume a role to access our Hashi Corp Vault password service.
- SNS for sending notifications to a topic so we can subscribe to them to be notified of any errors that may occur.

```yml
  iamRoleStatements:
    - Effect: Allow
      Action:
        - dynamodb:Query
        - dynamodb:Scan
        - dynamodb:GetItem
        - dynamodb:PutItem
        - ses:SendTemplatedEmail
        - sts:AssumeRole
        - sns:Publish
      Resource: "*"
```

Nearly there! Now we create the function definitions. We've got two lambda functions. One for handler the form submission and another for handling the form verification/submission of tickets.

```yml
functions:
  formSubmission:
    handler: index.submit
    memorySize: 128
    environment:
      VERIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL_ADDR: ${env:VERIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL_ADDR}
    description: Save the form entry details to DynamoDB and send the verification email.
    events:
      - http:
          path: formSubmit
          method: post
          private: true
          cors:
            origin: "*"
            headers:
              - Content-Type
              - X-Amz-Date
              - Authorization
              - X-Api-Key
              - X-Amz-Security-Token
              - X-Amz-User-Agent
            allowCredentials: true
  formVerification:
    handler: index.verify
    memorySize: 128
    environment:
      VAULT_DOMAIN: ${env:VAULT_DOMAIN}
      VAULT_PORT: ${env:VAULT_PORT}
      VAULT_IAM_ROLE: ${env:VAULT_IAM_ROLE}
      VAULT_SECRET_PATH: ${env:VAULT_SECRET_PATH}
      SERVICE_DESK_USERNAME: ${env:SERVICE_DESK_USERNAME}
      SERVICE_DESK_DOMAIN: ${env:SERVICE_DESK_DOMAIN}
      VERIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL_ADDR: ${env:VERIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL_ADDR}
    description: Verify the GET token header from the email verification link. Create the new Ticket. Delete the form entry from DynamoDB.
    events:
      - http:
          path: formVerfiy
          method: get
          private: false
```
